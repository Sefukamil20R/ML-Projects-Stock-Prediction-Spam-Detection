# ML Projects: Stock Price Prediction & Email Spam Detection

This repository contains two fundamental machine learning projects:

1. **Stock Price Prediction** using Regression models
2. **Email Spam Detection** using Classification models

Each project demonstrates key machine learning workflows, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.
